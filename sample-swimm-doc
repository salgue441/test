# Sample Document with SWIMM Tags

This is a sample document to test SWIMM custom HTML elements support in the document viewer.

## Introduction

This document demonstrates various SWIMM tags that can be used in your documentation. SWIMM tags are custom HTML elements that provide enhanced formatting and functionality.

## SWIMM Tags Examples

### Tags

You can use <swimm-tag>Important</swimm-tag> tags to highlight key information inline with your text. You can also use the shorter prefix: <swm-tag>Quick Tag</swm-tag>.

### Notes

<swimm-note>
This is a note using the swimm-note tag. Notes are great for providing additional context or explanations that are helpful but not critical.
</swimm-note>

<swm-note>
This note uses the shorter swm-note prefix. Both formats work identically.
</swm-note>

### Warnings

<swimm-warning>
This is a warning message. Use warnings to alert users about potential issues or important considerations they should be aware of.
</swimm-warning>

<swm-warning>
This warning uses the swm-warning prefix. Warnings are displayed with an orange color scheme to draw attention.
</swm-warning>

### Info Boxes

<swimm-info>
Info boxes are perfect for sharing useful information, tips, or best practices. They use a blue color scheme to distinguish them from warnings.
</swimm-info>

<swm-info>
This info box uses the shorter swm-info prefix. Info boxes help users understand concepts better.
</swm-info>

### Code Blocks

<swimm-code>
function example() {
  console.log("This is a code block using swimm-code");
  return "SWIMM tags are working!";
}
</swimm-code>

<swm-code>
const swimmTags = ['tag', 'note', 'warning', 'info', 'code', 'link'];
swimmTags.forEach(tag => console.log(`<swm-${tag}>`));
</swm-code>

### Links

You can create styled links using <swimm-link href="https://swimm.io">SWIMM's website</swimm-link> or <swm-link href="https://example.com">any other link</swm-link>.

## Mixed Content

Here's an example with multiple SWIMM tags in one paragraph:

This is a paragraph with an <swimm-tag>inline tag</swimm-tag> and a <swimm-link href="https://swimm.io">link to SWIMM</swimm-link>. You can combine different tags as needed.

<swimm-note>
You can also nest content within SWIMM tags. For example, you can include <swimm-tag>tags</swimm-tag> inside notes, or add <swimm-link href="https://example.com">links</swimm-link> to provide additional resources.
</swimm-note>

## Code Examples with SWIMM Tags

Here's a code example with SWIMM tags:

```javascript
// Regular markdown code block
function regularCode() {
  return "This is a regular code block"
}
```

<swimm-code>
// SWIMM code block
function swimmCode() {
  return "This is a SWIMM code block";
}
</swimm-code>

## Best Practices

<swimm-info>
**Tip:** Use SWIMM tags consistently throughout your documentation to maintain a professional and organized appearance.
</swimm-info>

<swimm-warning>
**Important:** Make sure to test your SWIMM tags after making changes to ensure they render correctly.

## Conclusion

This sample document demonstrates all the SWIMM tags that are currently supported:

- <swimm-tag>swimm-tag</swimm-tag> / <swm-tag>swm-tag</swm-tag>
- <swimm-note>swimm-note</swimm-note> / <swm-note>swm-note</swm-note>
- <swimm-warning>swimm-warning</swimm-warning> / <swm-warning>swm-warning</swm-warning>
- <swimm-info>swimm-info</swimm-info> / <swm-info>swm-info</swm-info>
- <swimm-code>swimm-code</swimm-code> / <swm-code>swm-code</swm-code>
- <swimm-link href="#">swimm-link</swimm-link> / <swm-link href="#">swm-link</swm-link>

All tags support both the `swimm-` and `swm-` prefixes for flexibility.
